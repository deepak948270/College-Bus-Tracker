        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our primary expectation is to acquire real-time information about the
          bus's location and promptly relay it to users. By doing so,
          individuals can efficiently manage their time, ensuring they arrive at
          their designated bus stop just before the bus arrives. This approach
          empowers commuters to make informed decisions, such as opting for
          alternative transportation if they miss the bus or find themselves
          running late. Ultimately, the aim is to enhance time management and
          provide users with a seamless and convenient commuting experience,
          minimizing wait times and mitigating the impact of unexpected delays.
